# colorSelectorGame
You will have to guess the correct colour given a RGB(red, green, blue) value generated by random. This is a demonstration of front-end web development using JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This is also a fun way to get good grasp on rgb() colour system which will be useful in more advanced front-end development later on.
